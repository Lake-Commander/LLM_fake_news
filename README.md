# 📰 Fake News Detection with LLM Features

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting fake news using traditional NLP features, metadata, and large language model (LLM)-derived features. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling and a deployable Streamlit web app.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to classify news articles as **fake** or **real** using both text-based and metadata-based features. We use a combination of:

- Word count and text length statistics
- Sentiment features
- Domain and time-based features
- Term frequency metrics
- Features derived from large language models (LLMs)

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning
- ✅ Feature engineering (NLP + metadata)
- ✅ Correlation and bivariate analysis
- ✅ Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- ✅ Web app for predictions using Streamlit

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.13
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Streamlit

## 🧪 Train Your Own Model
**To train a new model with your dataset:**

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format. Use the sample datasets here for schema reference.

2. Open and run fake_or_real.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

3. Follow the steps to preprocess, train, and save the model.

4. Ensure your app loads the new model path.
